        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Information Technology (IT) is the use of computers to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data or information.
            It encompasses a wide range of technologies, including hardware, software, networking, and more.</p>
        <p>IT professionals work in various fields, including software development, network administration, database management,
            web development, cybersecurity, and hardware engineering.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="branches">
        <h2>Branches of IT</h2>
        <div class="branch">
            <h3>Software Development</h3>
            <p>Software development involves creating, designing, and maintaining software applications and systems. It
                includes programming, testing, debugging, and documentation. Software developers use various programming
                languages and development tools to build applications for different platforms.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="branch">
            <h3>Network Administration</h3>
            <p>Network administration deals with the management, maintenance, and security of computer networks. Network
                administrators configure network devices, monitor network performance, troubleshoot network issues, and
                implement security measures to protect data and systems from unauthorized access.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="branch">
            <h3>Database Management</h3>
            <p>Database management involves designing, implementing, and maintaining databases to store and retrieve data
                efficiently. Database administrators manage databases, ensure data integrity, optimize database performance,
                and implement backup and recovery strategies.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="branch">
            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>Web development focuses on building and maintaining websites and web applications. Web developers use
                programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create user-friendly and interactive websites.
                They work on front-end development (client-side) and back-end development (server-side) to deliver
                dynamic web experiences.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="branch">
            <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
            <p>Cybersecurity ensures the protection of computer systems and data from unauthorized access, attacks,
                and breaches. Cybersecurity professionals implement security measures, such as firewalls, encryption,
                intrusion detection systems, and security policies, to safeguard information assets and mitigate cyber
                threats.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="branch">
            <h3>Hardware Engineering</h3>
            <p>Hardware engineering involves designing, building, and testing computer hardware components and systems.
                Hardware engineers design circuit boards, processors, memory modules, and other hardware components
                to meet performance, reliability, and cost requirements. They also work on computer architecture,
                embedded systems, and semiconductor technology.</p>
